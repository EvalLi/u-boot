This directory holds merge conflicts that were encountered when rebasing from the v2011.06
staging tree (with Joel's fixes to make second stage working) to v2011.09-rc1 in mainline.

Status of rebase:
Sep 17: All merge conflicts resolved, not build tested.

This could potentially break the second stage fixes. The idea behind rebasing is to pull
in all the latest SPL and arm fixes to start off on a good base for the first stage work.
However after this rebase, second stage might need work as well depending on what changed.
