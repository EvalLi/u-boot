This directory holds merge conflicts that were encountered when rebasing from the v2011.06
staging tree (with Joel's fixes to make second stage working) to v2011.09-rc1 in mainline.

Status of rebase:

Sep 19:
From the below Sep 17 changes, I pulled all post v2009-rc1 patches from Sandeep's next tree
There were sever merge conflicts with i2c so I handpicked 24 out of the 40 odd commits
These included:
- Simon's SPL patches
- GPIO framework migration + fixes to omap_gpio_dataout

For now I will hug these patches, they should disappear on the next rebase.


Sep 17: All merge conflicts resolved, not build tested.

This could potentially break the second stage fixes. The idea behind rebasing is to pull
in all the latest SPL and arm fixes to start off on a good base for the first stage work.
However after this rebase, second stage might need work as well depending on what changed.


Dev Status:

v2011.09-rc1+gpio+spl/nospl -	second stage working, first stage (SPL) tbd

v2011.06					-	second stage working, first stage (min config) incompatible
